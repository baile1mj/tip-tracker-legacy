<h3>Working With Files</h3>

<p>There are two types of files that Tip Tracker uses.  The global file and the data file.  The global file holds the template servers, program users, and the settings that pertain to the program itself.  Each data file holds all  tips for an individual pay period, the servers who received tips during that pay period, and the settings that pertain to that pay period.</p>
