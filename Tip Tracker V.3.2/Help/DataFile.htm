<h3>Data File</h3>
<p>Each data file holds information for one two-week pay period.  Included in this file are all of the tips, the settings for the pay period, and a list of servers who were copied from the template when the file was created.  Not all of the servers included in the data file will have tips, depending on whether the file was optimized after the pay period tips were balanced.</p>
